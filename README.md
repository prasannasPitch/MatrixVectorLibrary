#### Setting up Project:

1. Create the project by running the project/script createProject_windows.cmd from cmd (builds in windows). It builds necessary project files under project/windows. Set the cmake path variable to the path where your cmake bin folder is present .
Ex. SET CMAKE_PATH= your folder\cmake-3.10.2-win32-x86\bin in createProject_windows.cmd line 13.   
A sample main file has been included with the class files. A solution file (.sln) is generated for the main application using the class files.

2. Cmake is an opensource tool used for building solution file. This zip file includes one of the version which is used to build the project. Cmake can be found under Utils/cmake.
Any other necessary utility tools can be added under this directory just to have a clean project folders.

3. Class files can be seen under the source directory. Cmake builds the project using this directory.

4. All the project files can be accessed in project/windows and source files in source directory.
